(1) If two metric spaces have the same convergent subsequences, then they must have the same topology:

TODO: Prove this. 
(I really like this result).

Therefore, the topology on C(X) is unique in the following sense. 
Any metric on C(X) (which we need to make C(X) complete) such that f_n -> 0 iff sup(f) -> 0 will induce the same topology.

Furthermore, we want the topology on C_c^{infty}(Omega) to be 

Also, philosphically, I think the topologies and metrics should be all about the convergent sequences. This is what is usually used in practice and this is the better motivation.

In particular, for metrizable vector spaces, what sequences converge to 0 comppletely determines the topology!!!

TODO: Use this as motivation/justification for topologies/metrics/seminorms/norms on C_c(X) and C_c^{infty}.
